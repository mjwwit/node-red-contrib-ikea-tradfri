# Node-RED IKEA TRÅDFRI
Node-RED nodes to get updates from and control devices connected to an IKEA TRÅDFRI gateway. This project is based on [AlCalzone](https://github.com/AlCalzone)'s excellent [node-tradfri-client](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-tradfri-client) module, which does not utilize any compiled binaries.

## Installation
```
npm install node-red-contrib-ikea-tradfri
```

Alternatively, you can install this module through the editor UI palette.

## Documentation
This module contains 5 nodes:
- tradfri-config for connecting to the gateway
- tradfri-switch-control for controlling on/off capable devices (plugs and lightbulbs)
- tradfri-monitor for monitoring devices and groups
- tradfri-state for retrieving the current state of one or more devices and/or groups
- tradfri-light-control for controlling dimmable and rgb lights

### tradfri-config
This node is responsible for connecting to an IKEA TRÅDFRI gateway on your network. An attempt is made to automatically discover a gateway on the network. If this is unsuccessful a valid hostname or ip-address has to be entered. You also need to enter the gateways security code, as printed on the sticker on the bottom of the gateway. As per IKEA's guidelines, this code is not stored in Node-RED, instead, only the identity and pre-shared key returned after successful authentication are stored within the node.

### tradfri-switch-control
This node is able to control on/off capable devices connected to the gateway. It can do so in 2 different ways:

- you can configure which specific devices and/or groups to control within the nodes configuration,
- or you can specify these devices and/or groups in the input message passed to this node.

If both are specified, the node will pick the action (on or off) from the message, but execute that action on all devices and groups given in both the node configuration and the input message. Any combination of these input message and configuration properties is also possible.

#### Input
```json
{
  "topic": [1, 2],
  "payload": "on"
}

{
  "topic": 1,
  "payload": "off"
}

{
  "topic": 1,
}

{
  "payload": "on",
}

{}
```

### tradfri-monitor
This node will send messages when a device or group is updated or removed. The message will contain all available details for the device or group. Due to how this system works these update messages are also sent when reconnecting to the gateway after a flow deploy.

Depending on the type of event, `payload.event` will have a different value.

In case of the `"device updated"` event, depending on the type of the updated device one of the `blind`, `lightbulb`, `sensor`, or `plug` properties will be set and the others will be `undefined`.

#### Output
```json
{
  "topic": 1,

### tradfri-state
This node will retrieve the current state of one or more devices and/or groups. The output message will contain all available details for the devices and/or groups.

In case of device state, depending on the type of the updated device one of the `blind`, `lightbulb`, `sensor`, or `plug` properties will be set and the others will be `undefined`.

```json
{
  "topic": [1, 2]

### tradfri-light-control
This node is able to control lights connected to the gateway. It can do so in 2 different ways:

- you can configure which specific devices and/or groups to control within the nodes configuration,
- or you can specify these devices and/or groups in the input message passed to this node.

If both are specified, the node will pick the action (on or off) from the message, but execute that action on all devices and groups given in both the node configuration and the input message. Any combination of these input message and configuration properties is also possible.

The node is able to control dimmable lights, white spectrum lights, and RGB lights.

#### Input
```json
{
  "topic": [1, 2],
  "payload": {
    "onOff": true,
    "brightness": 50
  }
}

{
  "topic": 1,
  "payload": {
    "colorTemperature": 75,
    "brightness": 75
  }
}

{
  "topic": 1,
}

{
  "payload": {
    "color": "#ff0000",
    "brightness": 75
  },
}

{}
```

### tradfri-blind-control
This node is able to control blinds connected to the gateway. It can do so in 2 different ways:

- you can configure which specific devices and/or groups to control within the nodes configuration,
- or you can specify these devices and/or groups in the input message passed to this node.

If both are specified, the node will pick the operation from the message, but execute that action on all devices and groups given in both the node configuration and the input message. Any combination of these input message and configuration properties is also possible.

The node is able to control smart blinds.

#### Input
```json
{
  "topic": [1, 2],
  "payload": {
    "operation": "setPosition",
    "position": 50
  }
}

{
  "topic": 1,
  "payload": {
    "operation": "stop"
  }
}

{
  "topic": 1,
}

{
  "payload": {
    "operation": "setPosition"
  },
}

{}
```
